# Coding Analogy
Generally speaking programs, frameworks, & libraries are all code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks without having to "reinvent the wheel" & code it all by yourself.

## Details
- The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called **Inversion of Control**.
- When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application.
- You are choosing when and where to use the library in your code, but you provide the overall structure of the code.
- When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow.
- It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

## Conclusion
- A framework inverts the control of the program, it tells the developer what they need.
- A library doesnâ€™t, the programmer calls the library where and when they need it.
