# Coding Analogy
Generally speaking programs, frameworks, & libraries are all code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks without having to "reinvent the wheel" & code it all by yourself.


- An application is computer software designed to help a user perform specific tasks.
- A computing platform includes a hardware architecture and a software framework that allow application software to run—for example, the operating system and programming languages.
- A software framework helps facilitate software development by providing generic capabilities that can be changed or configured to create a specific software application.


## Details
- The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called **Inversion of Control**.
- When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application.
- You are choosing when and where to use the library in your code, but you provide the overall structure of the code.
- When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow.
- It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

## Conclusion
- A framework inverts the control of the program, it tells the developer what they need.
- A library doesn’t, the programmer calls the library where and when they need it.
