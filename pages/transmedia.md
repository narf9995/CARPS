- **Concepts**
  - **Characters**: the importance of narrative.
  - **Convenience**: the importance of getting the right content to the right people at the right time
  - **Community**: the importance of connecting fans & rewarding them.


- **Intersections**
  - **Characters** + **Convenience** = **Personalization**
    - The personalization of the story experience for each person based on their relationship to the world
  - **Convenience** + **Community** = **Inter-Community Interaction**
    - The continued “personalization” but in a broader sense as applied to audience segments. For example an audience team collaborates to unlock content that only they can see. Also at this intersection is the ability to share content & refer friends to the world
  - **Community** + **Characters** = **Community Interaction**
    - The relationship between the community & the world. Creators should provide opportunities to strengthen the relationship through procedures & technology to allow fan contributions, character interactions & such like.
