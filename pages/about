The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called **inversion of control**.
When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application.
You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow.
It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.
