# Adventure Design Principles in the OSR

Archive of this [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRPGAdventureForge/comments/stonz1/adventure_design_principles_in_the_osr/).

The OSR is an RPG subculture that prioritizes exploration, player freedom, immersion, and challenge (by challenge I don't mean rules mastery, or even combat, but rather overcoming difficult in-world obstacles in creative ways). What's interesting about it in the context of this sub is that the OSR blogosphere has spent a solid decade collaborating intensely on developing the principles and procedures necessary to build adventures with these priorities.

Rather than try to summarize it all, I'll be linking a bunch of "essential posts" that explain things better than I could. One thing you may notice though is that in the OSR, designing an adventure is really about designing a *place*, rather than events or scenes. It's all about building the kind of environments that:
1. Are rewarding to explore
2. Present or generate interesting and unexpected challenges and
3. Prompt the players to treat the fictional world like it's real.

>it’s not just random chance that’s resulting in different groups having different experiences: Each group is actively making the dungeon their own. They can retreat, circle around, rush ahead, go back over old ground, poke around, sneak through, interrogate the locals for secret routes… The possibilities are endless because the environment isn’t forcing them along a pre-designed path. And throughout it all, the players are experiencing the thrill of truly exploring the dungeon complex.

> Make it personal.  The plot cannot be about saving the world, because murderhoboes don't want to save the world.  It needs to be about the PCs.  The heavy handed way to do this is to make it about saving themselves, because murderhoboes always want to save themselves.  This is an option, just remember that you don't have to make it deadly, you just have to make it personal.

[Analog, Digital, Procedural](http://rolesrules.blogspot.com/2012/04/analog-digital-procedural.html)
>You see, in Old School play ... *fluff is crunch*. The sandy floor, moist walls made of soft stone, composition of the gate, and disposition of the kobolds all can feed into the players' improvised plans and the DM's improvised rulings.

[Dungeon Checklist](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/01/dungeon-checklist.html)
>Read it once before you write you dungeon.  Then read it again when you're done, to make sure you got everything.

[OSR Style Challenges: "Rulings Not Rules" is Insufficient](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/02/osr-style-challenges-rulings-not-rules.html)
>  Writing a good OSR-style problem is tougher than it sounds.  It needs to be something that has no easy solution, has many difficult solutions, requires no special tools (e.g. unique spells, plot devices), can be solved with common sense (as opposed to system knowledge or setting lore), isn't solvable through some ability someone has on their character sheet. 

[Interesting and Useful Dungeon Descriptions](http://blog.trilemma.com/2014/10/interesting-and-useful-dungeon.html)
> For players to want to risk their lives collecting information, they have to believe it's going to pay off. This means they need to believe that **they are surrounded by useful information.**

[What is Tested?](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2015/05/what-is-tested.html)
> When designing a dungeon, one question you should ask yourself is: What am I testing for? Math tests challenge your math skills.  Drinking contests challenge your liver and your brain.  But what does your dungeon test? How is the wheat separated from the chaff?

[Elementary Principles of Dungeon Drawing](https://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/2017/02/elementary-principles-of-dungeon-drawing.html)
>From the perspective of PC movement, just about anything you can place in a dungeon that isn't treasure will be one of three things: a speed-bump, a barrier, or a deflector.

[Dungeon layout, map flow and old school game design](https://www.enworld.org/threads/dungeon-layout-map-flow-and-old-school-game-design.168563/)
>Fundamentally, a good map should enhance the factors which make dungeon crawling enthralling: for instance, exploration, player decision making, uncovering hidden areas and secrets, as well as maintaining the pace of action.

[Bryce Lynch's Primer on Adventure Design](https://into-the-dark-rpg.blogspot.com/2015/06/these-two-game-reviews-by-bryce-lynch.html)
> Choices: There should be more than one course of action available to players in order for the adventure to continue. Avoid choke points—both literal choke points in the physical layouts of dungeons and other locations, and figurative choke points which require a unique decision or solution in order for the adventure to proceed. 

[Old School Space vs New School Time](http://udan-adan.blogspot.com/2016/11/old-school-space-vs-new-school-time.html)
>What keeps striking me about the better-written Pathfinder adventures is how easy it would be to blow them open. Arrange them across space instead of time: turn scenes 1-10 into locations 1-10, and let the PCs wander between them at will.

[Encouraging Scheming](https://www.bastionland.com/2018/09/encouraging-scheming.html)
>If your wizard spell list is "Fireball, Magic Missile, Lightning Bolt, Sleep" then you could have an okay heist, but it's probably going to be more of a head-on assault.
If it's "Charm Person, Floating Disc, Summon Toads, Change Weather" then you're going to have to get clever, but the result will be more fun.
