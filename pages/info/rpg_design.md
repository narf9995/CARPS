# RPG Design
Archive of this post

When I’m thinking about this concern in my own work, I break it out into a whole array of design questions.

## Replayability:

- Do I intend this game for single-session play or multi-session play? If the latter, how do I win the players over into playing the next session?

- Do I intend this game to come to a definite end after just a few sessions, to come to an end when the players want it to, or to play on indefinitely? After the game’s ended, do I intend the players to play it again in the same group, or do I expect the group to be done with the game?

- After the game’s ended, do I intend any of its players to play it again with a different group, or do I expect them as players to be done with the game?

- How much planning and commitment does this game require? Does it offer enough back to the group to make good on their investment?

- Or how about this one: Do I care whether people replay this game at all, or do I hope that they play it once, and go on to check out my other games instead?

## Specificity

- What’s the entire range of actions and situations that I intend this game to cover? Everything? A wide range, but not everything? A narrow range?

- For actions and situations outside of its intended range, how does the game handle them? By shunting them into a general catch-all? By handwaving them? By disallowing them? By leaving them unaddressed?

- What’s the game’s model for actions and situations within its range? Humanistic? Elemental? Cinematic? Philosophical? Psychological? Literary? Poetic? Magickal? Or what?

For any given individual action or situation within its range:

- Should this be its own move? Should it be an option in a more general move? Should it be a category of more specific moves?

- Should this be a move or option that every character has access to? Many characters, but not every one? Only one character? Only characters in a particular circumstance? Or who?

- Should the game set this action or situation on equal footing with others? Should it play it up? Play it down? Highlight it? Put it behind warning tape? Or what?

## Marketing

- Is this game’s audience people who’ve played my other games, people who’ve played other games like mine, people who’ve played ttrpgs, people who like D&D, people who’ve played D&D and want something the same but different, people who’ve never roleplayed?

- At their first encounter with these moves, do I want the audience to feel comfortable or unsettled? Do I want them to feel like an insider with previous experience to build on, or an outsider standing at a newly-opened door?

- Do I want these moves to cater to the audience’s expectations, ease the audience into new ways of thinking, or challenge the audience to keep up?

- Am I marketing playing this game, GMing this game, reading this game, discussing this game, or just buying this game? In what order of priority?

- Am I marketing this particular game, a series of games, all my games, this approach to designing games, indie games, or roleplaying games (as opposed to other leisure activities)? In what order of priority?

- What obstacles stand between the game’s audience now and their sitting down to play it? How does it help them navigate these obstacles? Which obstacles does it leave for them to overcome without its help?

So I guess here’s my caution: taking these questions and summing them up as a principle, like “specificity of moves is good for marketing but reduces replayability,” really flattens out a complex body of concerns.

Even if it’s true in general — which I have no idea, we’d have to conduct real research to find out — no game exists in general. Every game exists in its own unique, real position in the overlap between its creator’s intentions and its audience’s needs.

In other words, even if it’s true, it doesn’t matter! Every game would be a special case.
