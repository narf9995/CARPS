# Death Rules
1. If the party puts your character's body to rest in accordance to your beliefs including all of your belongings & equipment not promised to other characters before death, your new character recieves half of your previous character's XP total. The other half of your XP is split evenly amongst the party that retrieved your corpse.
2. On top of that, if your new character is somehow related to the party or location, you gain an additional 1/10th of your previous character's XP total upon creation 

This means a low level character may be brought back, if it's convenient. But for high level character, folks go to great lengths to retrieve the *hero's* body for a mournful ceremony (especially when they're lower level than the deceased, which feels thematically appropriate).
