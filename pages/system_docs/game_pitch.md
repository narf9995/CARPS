# Craps-based Accessible Role Playing System (CARPS)

## Premise
With accessibility in mind; could a narrative-focused RPG with an OSR/Nu-SR design ethos be created using the established odds of street craps (2d6 summed), with complex interpretation of those results, while staying simple to read, understand, & run?


## Core Concepts
- accessibility focus: WCAG compliant, screenreader compatible, limited images, & limited math
- simple concepts for new players, kids, elderly, & cognitvely impared persons
- markdown & YAML for easy formating & localization
- generic, setting agnostic rules
- limited resources required to play
- require 2d6 only *(based on Street Craps)*
- limit unnecessary dice rolls
- dice can be cleary & quickly read
- SRD can fit on 1 sheet of A4 paper
- clear, yet narratively abstract rules
- minimal, yet comprehensive rules
- storytelling/narrative focus
- players can meaningfully (& mechanically) affect narrative
- connect players with world via mechanics
- ages 5 and up with an adult 
- open, modular, easy to homebrew
- online, cross-platform, cheap to print
- small & non-proprietary file formats
- treated like an open-source code project
- *Unintended Bonus: 1-digit addition practice disguised as game*


## Introduction
### Problem
In my opinion, many popular role-playing systems have a major problem; which is their level of accessibility. Systems frequently require many specialized dice & books, on-boarding of system/setting specific rules for both gamemaster & player, & require a level of familiarity for adequate player risk assessment. This creates a "black box" situation where the gamemaster understands the inner working of the game & the associated risks to actions, but the players are blind as to how their actions are actually orchestrated mechanically & the mathematical odds of their success.

New players, particularly those unfamiliar with tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) or computer RPGs (JRPG, MMORPG, etc.), tend to have great ideas visually/narratively, but struggle to implement them within the mechanics of the system. This may be frustrating for all parties involved as it can be to the detriment of the players own fun, the fun of the party, & even take away valuable playing time while reviewing rules.

The following situation may be familiar to you:

    GM: Your turn Mage.
    New Mage: I cast a spell!
    GM: What Spell?
    New Mage: Uh...
    [5 Minutes Later]
    GM: ...Okay, so you cast fireball at the enemy.
    The spell has an area of effect within a 20-foot radius.
    It appears the Paladin is within that area.
    Paladin: God damn it, not again.
    GM: Give me a reflex save Paladin.
    New Mage: Wait... what?

#### For Gamemasters
It's easy to place the blame on the players for not learning the system you as a gamemaster had to learn, but keep in mind that people have different skill sets & learning methods. What makes sense to you might not make sense to them & vice versa. If this is a recurring issue across systems, players, & gamemasters, as I have observed; then there must be some core issue regarding accessibility in RPGs as a emerging form of [transmedia](https://github.com/narf9995/CARPS/blob/main/pages/transmedia.md) storytelling.
