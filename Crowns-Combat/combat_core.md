## Core
The Core System is the basic "rules light" version of combat that's intended to be simple & easy while still covering most things that could happen (with minor concessions). It's the core structure on which increasingly complex combat systems can be built.

**Important Notation:**
- **U = Unit (typically *Yards* or *Meters*)**
  - For our purposes, there is **1 U (yard/meter) for every 3 feet**.
    - So to convert from U to feet, divide the sum by 3.
    - To convert from feet to U, multiply the sum by 3.
  - Although yards & meters have slightly different lengths, a concession is made for easy localization.
    - You may **replace U with the unit you are most comfortable with** when reading anything with this notation.
    - You can even substitute another unit such as an inch or mile if your scale changes significantly.
  - Alternatively, 2U is 6 feet, which is *almost* 5 feet. **If you don't care about specific measurements, you can just subsutitute 2U squares for the standard 5ft squares** with basically zero side effects to gameplay. 
  
  - **Ultimately, the only thing that matters is that you have a *standardized unit of space.***

### Basics
#### Turn Order & Actions
If one side is ambushing the other, they and their allies go first. Otherwise, each combatant makes a COR save to see if they act before their targets. This save reoccurs at the start of each turn. 

### Zones
#### Overview
In combat, characters occupy one of 4 Zones which represent areas close to the combat.

The 4 zones during combat are:
- Grappling
- Close
- Near
- Far

In each zone you can make different attacks.

It takes a number of Move actions equal to the Distance Value of a Zone for a combatant to move in or out of that Zone.

**Name** | **Distance Value (DV)** | **Range (Feet)** | **Allowed Attacks**
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
**Grappling** | 0 | 0-1U (0-3ft) | Hand-to-Hand & Light Melee
**Close** | 0 | 1-2U (4-6ft) | Hand-to-Hand, Light Melee, Medium Melee, Heavy Melee†, & Magic
**Near** | 1 | 3-4U (7-12ft) | Heavy Melee, Ranged, & Magic
**Far** | 2 | 5-20U (13-60ft) | Ranged & Magic
**Evade** | 2* | State | Strong Magic

*This is a disengaged State with no relative position in combat. It only costs 2 Move Actions for game mechanic purposes & denotes no rank among the other distances.

†This attack gains Disadvantage in this Zone (without a Feat).


#### Details

> Zones are formatted as follows: "**Zone Name - Zone #** *(aproximate distance range)*"

In **Grapplling - 0** *(0 yards)*, you can attack with:
- Hand-to-Hand
- Light Melee

In the **Close Zone - 1** *(1 to 2 yards)*, you can attack with:
- Hand-to-Hand
- Light Melee
- Medium Melee
- Heavy Melee†

In the **Near Zone - 2** *(3 to 4 U)*, you can attack with:
- Heavy Melee
- Close-Ranged

In the **Far Zone - 3** *(11 to 60 feet)*, you can attack with:
- Short-Ranged

When combat begins, if neither group is **Surprised**, all combatants currently engaged with are in the **Near Zone**. If one group has a significant advantage/disadvantage such as **Surprised**, the group with the advantage can pick which zones they occupy.

##### Zones Explained
Generally, Zones should viewed from the  perspective of the group with the advantage in combat with ties being decided by a simple majority at the beginning of combat. “I’m staying back at a Ranged Distance” or “I’m closing to Close Range” is one way to view it. Opponents & Allies move between Zones just as players can, instead of remaining “stationary” as the adventurers move around them.

Think of it like the combat is the eye of the storm & everything swirls around the center majority of the combat. Alternatively put, it's like the rings of an arrow/dart target. Obviously this is an extreme abstraction, as such, the GM should remember that both the opponents & the players actually move around in their space even when not traversing zones, and describe it that way. Zones are meant to abstract relative distance & add positional tactics to theatre of mind combat that lacks miniatures/grids.

##### Move Actions Explained
For a combatant to move between zones, it takes a number of Move Actions equal to the Distance Value of the Zone currently being entered. For example, entering Grappling costs 0 MA, but leaving it costs 1 MA as your are actually entering the Close Zone.

The size of combat is limited by the size of the environment. If the space is 60ft (20U) or smaller then Far is the greatest distance possible. If the space is 9ft (3U) or smaller then Ranged combat is not possible without Feats or some other sort of special equipment/abilities. Outdoors any distance is theoretically possible.
