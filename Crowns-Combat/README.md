# CARPS-Style Combat for Crowns

## Intro
This combat system was originally developed for the currently incomplete CARPS 0.1 Alpha. This edition of the ruleset has been heavily modified and is dependent on Crowns 1e to be a fully functional role-playing system. It references several Saves and Conditions that are not present in this document. The "extended" variation of the rules currently has text lifted directly from Crown 1e to replace the CARPS specific rules; This text will be replaced with paraphrased set Crowns-compatible rules in the next release.

This combat system was ultimately inspired by a combination of Crowns 1e, Mausritter, â€¢Hack (white/back/red/etc.), Knave, WFRP 4e, Genesys, Ironsworn, and many, many more systems. But Crowns 1e and the GMing style of it's author are the primary influences to it's development. While I take credit for this specific combination of ideas, I cannot take credit the ideas themselves.

## Directory
There are 3 variations of the system:
- [Core](https://github.com/narf9995/CARPS/blob/main/Crowns-Combat/combat_core.md)
- [Extended](https://github.com/narf9995/CARPS/blob/main/Crowns-Combat/combat_extended.md)
- [Advanced](https://github.com/narf9995/CARPS/blob/main/Crowns-Combat/combat_advanced.md)

**Core** is the basic system with a focus on simplicity.

**Extended** is an expanded ruleset that shows how CARPS-style combat can be implemented in another role-playing system or expanded with your own houserules.

**Advanced** is a collection of compatible ideas that could be added in or built upon, mainly to demonstate the modularity of the system.
