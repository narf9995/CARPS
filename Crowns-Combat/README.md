# Crowns-Combat Edition: CARPS-Style Combat for Crowns 1e

## Intro
This combat system was originally developed for the currently incomplete CARPS 0.1 Alpha. This edition of the ruleset has been heavily modified and is dependent on Crowns 1e to be a fully functional role-playing system. It references several Saves and Conditions that are not present in this document. The "extended" variation of the rules currently has text lifted directly from Crown 1e that has been modified to work with CARPS Movement Action and Zones. This text will be replaced with fully paraphrased set of Crowns-compatible rules in the next release. For this reason, the Extended variation contained in the "Crowns-Combat Edition" is not licensed or guaranteed in any fashion.

This rest of this system is being openly developed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) (TL;DR: you can use this content freely and make your product, but I guarantee nothing about my product), and as such, if there is content present in this document that you feel to be infringing on your copyright or license, please contact the dev at [narf9995@gmail.com](narf9995@gmail.com) in order to resolve the issue as quickly and effectively as possible. Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.

This combat system was ultimately inspired by a combination of Crowns 1e, Mausritter, â€¢Hack (white/back/red/etc.), Knave, WFRP 4e, Genesys, Ironsworn, and many, many more systems. But Crowns 1e and the GMing style of it's author are the primary influences to it's development. While I take credit for this specific combination of ideas, I cannot take credit the ideas themselves.

## Directory
There are 3 variations of the system:
- [Core](https://github.com/narf9995/CARPS/blob/main/Crowns-Combat/combat_core.md)
- [Extended](https://github.com/narf9995/CARPS/blob/main/Crowns-Combat/combat_extended.md)
- [Advanced](https://github.com/narf9995/CARPS/blob/main/Crowns-Combat/combat_advanced.md)

**Core** is the basic system with a focus on simplicity. **Extended** is an expanded ruleset that shows how CARPS-style combat can be implemented in another role-playing system such as Crowns or expanded with your own houserules. **Advanced** is a collection of compatible ideas that could be added in or built upon, mainly to demonstate the modularity of the system.
