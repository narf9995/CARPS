## Advanced
This is a library of new modular systems (& variations of existing ones) that you can add without significant concern of upsetting game balance. It will also contain some incomplete concepts or suggestions for ideas.

### Additional Zones
Here are 2 other more Zones that may only come into play in niches (or late-game) scenarios & advanced playstyles.

In the **Visible Zone** *(Within 3 miles)*, you can attack with:
- Long-Ranged
- Strong Magic

In the **Remote Zone** *(Within 6 miles)*, you can attack with:
- Artillery/Siege
- Extreme Magic

Regular Magic Attacks or Spells cannot be used in the **Visible Zone** or **Remote Zone**.

### Cardinal Directions
The cardinal directions (a.k.a "compass directions") are listed in clockwise order:

**Cardinal Direction** | **Degree Value** | **Layman Terms** | **Clock Value**
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
North | 0/360° | "Up" | "12”
North East | 45° | "Up & Right" | ”3”
East | 90° | "Right" | ”6”
South East | 135° | "Down & Right" | "9 o'clock"
South | 180° | "Down" | "12 o'clock"
South West | 225° | "Down & Left" | "3 o'clock"
West | 270° | "Left" | "6 o'clock"
North West | 315° | "Up & Left" | "9 o'clock"

It costs a number of Move Actions (MA) equal to the Zones DV to move to an adjacent cardinal direction (ie. North to North East costs 1 MA while in the Close Zone [1x1] or 2 MA in the  Far Zone [1x2], while going from South to West costs 2 MA while in the Close Zone [1x2] or 4 MA in the  Far Zone [2x2]).
