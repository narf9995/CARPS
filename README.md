# Craps Accesible Role-Play System (CARPS)

## Thesis:
Placeholder Text.

## Introduction
### Problem:
In my opinion, many popular role-playing systems have a major problem; which is their level of accessibility. Systems frequently require many specialized dice & books, on-boarding of system/setting specific rules for both gamemaster & player, and require a level of familiarity for adequate player risk assessment. This creates a "black box" situation where the gamemaster understands the inner working of the game and the associated risks to actions, but the players are blind as to how their actions are actually orchestrated mechanically & the mathematical odds of their success.

New players, particularly those unfamiliar with tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) or computer RPGs (JRPG, MMORPG, etc.), tend to have great ideas visually/narratively, but struggle to implement them within the mechanics of the system. This may be frustrating for all parties involved as it can be to the detriment of the players own fun, the fun of the party, and even take away valuable playing time while reviewing rules.

The situation below may be familiar to you:

    GM: Your turn Mage.
    New Mage: I cast a spell!
    GM: What Spell?
    New Mage: Uh...
    [5 Minutes Later]
    GM: ...Okay, so you cast fireball at the enemy.
    The spell has an area of effect within a 20-foot radius.
    It appears the Paladin is within that area.
    Paladin: God damn it, not again.
    GM: Give me a reflex save Paladin.
    New Mage: Wait... what?

It's easy to place the blame on the players for not learning the system you as a gamemaster had to learn, but keep in mind that people have different skill sets and learning methods. What makes sense to you might not make sense to them and vice versa. If this is a recurring issue across systems, players, & gamemasters, as I have observed; then there must be some core issue regarding accessibility in RPGs as a emerging form of **transmedia** storytelling.

**Transmedia is defined as:** a narrative that extends beyond multiple media forms (often digital) that also plays to the strength those forms; that may or may not be interactive.

It historically referred to the News/TV media paradigm, but in the digital era it's definition has expanded to include many new & emerging mediums such as Role-Playing Games, Video Games, Alternate/Augmented Reality Games, etc. It is also a concept applied in PR/Marketing.

**"3 C's" of Transmedia**

![Transmedia Venn Diagram](/images/the-three-Cs-of-transmedia-storytelling.jpg)
- **Concepts**
  - **Characters**: the importance of narrative.
  - **Convenience**: the importance of getting the right content to the right people at the right time
  - **Community**: the importance of connecting fans and rewarding them.


- **Intersections**
  - **Characters** + **Convenience** = **Personalization**
    - The personalization of the story experience for each person based on their relationship to the world
  - **Convenience** + **Community** = **Inter-Community Interaction**
    - The continued “personalization” but in a broader sense as applied to audience segments. For example an audience team collaborates to unlock content that only they can see. Also at this intersection is the ability to share content and refer friends to the world
  - **Community** + **Characters** = **Community Interaction**
    - The relationship between the community and the world. Creators should provide opportunities to strengthen the relationship through procedures and technology to allow fan contributions, character interactions and such like.
